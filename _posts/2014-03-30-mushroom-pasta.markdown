Sunday: the fragrance of garlic in the air, the bubbling pot of pasta, and a jumble of fresh mushrooms.

This weekend, I wanted to make a recipe from my go-to cookbook, "Vegetable of the Day," by Kate McMillan. Let me say, it did not disappoint!

## Garlic Butter Mushrooms ##

### Good for: ###
* feeding guests
* potlucks

### Recipe: ###
*Yields 4 servings. Prep 5 mins, Cooks in 25 mins*

1. From your pantry - minced garlic, butter, salt/pepper

2. Buy 1 pound mushrooms. Bonus: pine nuts (they're not cheap, but provide a nice crunch)

3. Prep - preheat oven 450F. Take off mushroom stems, rinse, cut into similar sizes. Butter should be used sparingly; I cut a piece that was as thick as my pinky. Melt butter somewhat; mine was soft enough to spread.

4. Bowl - minced garlic, butter, salt/pepper to taste. Smear onto the mushrooms.

5. Baking pan (foil if necessary) - Dump it onto the baking pan.

6. Put in oven, 15 min.

7. Add pine nuts, return to oven 10 min.

### Ideas: ###
* Serve with pasta! The pasta was simply tossed in oil, red pepper flakes, browned garlic, and herbs de provence.
* Next time, I'd like to add some caramelized onions.
