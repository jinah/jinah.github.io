            <h1>ng-meetup</h1>

<p>Yesterday, I convinced Christine and Chloe to join me and Isaac for a scintillating talk on Angular.js. It almost didn&#39;t happen. But in the end, everyone was glad they went!</p>

<p>This js.la event featured Ari Lerner, author of <em>ng-book</em>. The presentation was fantastic for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>He had a well-designed HTML presentation with interactive demos</li>
<li>He made us laugh a lot with his awkward sense of humor</li>
<li>He went fast, so it wasn&#39;t boring</li>
</ol>

<p>Going into the talk, I didn&#39;t know any Angular, but I left a little more enlightened. Here are three things I learned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Angular addresses tight-coupling between disparate js and html files. A designer might change a &lt;h1&gt; tag to &lt;h2&gt;, yet the js would still be looking for a &lt;h1&gt;. This is tight-coupling.</li>
<li>Directives are functions attached to tags. It looks like ng-[something], but is the same as data-ng-[something].</li>
<li>When you add &#39;ng-controller&#39; to a tag, you can access its methods in any of the tag&#39;s children. The methods are defined in the js as $scope.[functionName].</li>
</ol>

<p>There was one important way Ari could have improved his talk: focus on teaching. He had a tendency to promote his book. At first, the addendum &quot;There&#39;s a book on that&quot; was funny, but responding with simply that to a Q/A question was doing a disservice to the audience. Clearly he knows his stuff, because he&#39;d say &quot;There are 90 pages on that topic in my book.&quot; So please, answer the question.</p>

<p>Overall, I did borrow a copy of his book, and I&#39;m excited to try it out.</p>
